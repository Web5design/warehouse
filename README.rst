Warehouse: API Driven Python Package Index
==========================================

Warehouse is a BSD Licensed API driven Python package index.

Warehouse is a re-envisioning of a Python package index. It is based around the
idea of a clean API that exposes a developer friendly API. It focuses strongly
on making it possible for clients to efficiently query the available meta-data and
provide, and where possible enforce, practices and tooling that enable an end to
end secure installation story.

Warehouse is part of the Crate project, a set of applications, tools, and libraries
for creating, distributing, and installing Python packages in a secure, efficient,
and reliable way.
